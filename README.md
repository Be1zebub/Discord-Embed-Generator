Now its capabilities are limited, since do simple&convenient thing was my goal.
If you want to improve this project, create a fork and do a pull request to upstream.  
I would not like to deviate from the principles of a simple application, so if you want to expand capabilities: add a button "advanced mode" that shows/hides additional fields.
